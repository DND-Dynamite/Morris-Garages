I'll create a 3D car viewer app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. Since you mentioned loading from assets, I'll set it up to load a 3D model file, though you'll need to replace the model path with your actual car model file.I've created a comprehensive 3D car viewer app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. Here's what the app includes:

## Features:
- **3D Car Model Display**: Shows a placeholder car model (since no actual model file was provided)
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Mouse orbit controls to rotate the camera around the car
  - Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
  - Control panel for customization
- **Customization Options**:
  - Adjustable rotation speed
  - Camera distance control
  - Lighting intensity adjustment
  - Color picker for changing car colors
- **Professional UI**: Modern glassmorphism design with smooth animations

## Technical Implementation:
- **Three.js Scene**: Complete 3D environment with camera, lights, and materials
- **Lighting System**: Multiple lights including ambient, directional, and fill lights
- **Shadow Mapping**: Realistic shadows for enhanced visual appeal
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## To Use Your Own Car Model:
Replace the `createPlaceholderCar()` function with actual model loading code:

```javascript
const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
loader.load('assets/your-car-model.glb', (gltf) => {
    this.carModel = gltf.scene;
    this.carModel.scale.setScalar(1);
    this.scene.add(this.carModel);
    this.hideLoading();
});
```

## Supported Model Formats:
- **GLTF/GLB** (recommended): Best for web, supports materials and animations
- **OBJ**: Basic geometry support
- **FBX**: Requires additional loader

The app currently shows a placeholder car made of geometric shapes to demonstrate all functionality. Simply replace the model loading code with your actual car model file path!
